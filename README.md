This project is an online marketplace where people can sell their used stuff. Sellers post their items, and if someone likes it, they can make an offer to buy it. If the seller agrees to the offer, the item is sold to that buyer.

Project Plan:
1. Design Database
2. Create a guideline for UI
3. Write Backend
4. Write Frontend
5. Connect Frontend with Backend via API.
